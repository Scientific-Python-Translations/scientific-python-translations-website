Funded by the [Scientific Python Community and Communications Infrastructure grant](https://scientific-python.org/doc/scientific-python-community-and-communications-infrastructure-2022.pdf) from the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) (CZI), [Scientific Python](https://scientific-python.org/) and [Quansight Labs](https://labs.quansight.org/) are able to offer assistance to the maintainer teams of the [Scientific Python Core Projects](https://scientific-python.org/specs/core-projects/) to develop and publish translations of their core project websites. The goal is to allow as much of the necessary work as possible to be offloaded onto a small team of Quansight Labs staff working across the different projects, freeing busy maintainers from the burden of setting up translation infrastructure and recruiting and coordinating with translators, and helping to integrate these translations into the project websites. See the [FAQ](/faq) for more information.
